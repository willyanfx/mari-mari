A 58-year-old patient who was admitted to the ward late last night and is awaiting amputation of their right foot due to complications associated with diabetes.<strong> – CORRECT</strong> </p> <ul style="text-align: left"> <li> This patient should be prioritized first given that they are newly admitted and have not yet been seen by physiotherapy, and most likely have mobility related issues given their medical history. It does not state when surgery is happening, so the physiotherapist should prioritize seeing this patient to determine their current mobility status and intervene as necessary. </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: left"> B. A 56-year-old patient who is 4 days post right transtibial amputation and requires 2 assistance to transfer into their wheelchair. </p> <ul style="text-align: left"> <li> This patient is 4 days post and requires assistance to mobilize. Given that they require assistance to mobilize, they should be prioritized, but not above a patient with mobility challenges who has yet to be seen by the physiotherapist. </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: left"> C. A 67-year-old patient who is recovering from a bowel resection requires a progression of their current physiotherapy assistant (PTA) program. </p> <ul style="text-align: left"> <li> This patient would be the lowest priority. They are already working with the PTA and participating in rehabilitation. While it is important to progress their program, this is not an urgent matter as the patient will not deteriorate if not seen by the physiotherapist. </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: left"> D. A 47-year-old patient who is deconditioned due to complex medical issues and requires 1 assistance to mobilize with a walker. </p> <ul style="text-align: left"> <li> This patient is deconditioned and requires assistance to mobilize. Given that they require assistance to mobilize, they should be prioritized, but not above a patient with mobility challenges who has yet to be seen by the physiotherapist. </li> </ul> </div>'}]}];export{t as a,e as t};
